With each Kuberentes' breaking api change. There will be a new breaking change in K8Guard releases.

For that reason, K8Guard microservices versions will be pinned down to a "code name". that will be mountain names from A to Z.


For example the first code name, `Awyar` (which is a beautiful mountain in Kurdistan) has all the k8guards microservices' versions that works with Kuberentes 1.5 and the second code name which is `Bear` (a mountain in New York state), has all the versions for Kuberentes 1.6.
